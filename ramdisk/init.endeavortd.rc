# Since it is not recommended to provide a custom init.rc HTCs changes to it
# were extracted into init.endeavortd.htc.rc.
# Even though some of HTCs services are not relevant to CM I didn't remove them
# yet. In case modifications were made they are marked with a "# CM:" comment to
# make it easier to detect them.
#
# Add your changes to this file if they need to be executed before the imports
# or to init.endeavortd.cm.rc if it doesn't matter.
